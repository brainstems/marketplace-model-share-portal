              accordance with this Agreement. Customer undertakes to comply with
              the terms of this Agreement and all laws, rules and regulations

              1.2 To access JedAI Feeds and to participate as a JedAI, the

              1.3 The JedAI connects JedAIs and Traders directly, without any
              3rd party control via the JedAI. This means that while providing
              predictions as a JedAI, Customers are responsible for their own
              activity. This means that while purchasing Prediction Feeds as a
              Trader, Customers are responsible for their own activity.
              Customers must adhere to the laws in their own legal jurisdiction
              as well as their conscience. Brainstems is not responsible for any
              malicious use of the JedAI or any losses associated with the use
              of the JedAI or any source.

              which is available at the JedAI, and which may be modified from
              time to time at our sole discretion. We are only providing our
              services if you accept all of these terms. By using the JedAI, the
              Customer confirms their understanding and agrees to be bound by
              all of these terms. If Customer accepts these terms on behalf of a
              company or other legal entity, Customer represents that they have
              the legal authority to accept these terms on that entity’s behalf,

              4.1 Customer is responsible for all activities, regardless of
              whether the activities are authorized by Customer or undertaken by
              Customer, Customer’s employees or a third party (including
              Customer’s contractors, agents or End Users). Brainstems and its
              affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to Customer
              Account.
            </li>
            <li>
              4.2 Customer will ensure that published assets and Customer and
              End Users’ use of published assets or the JedAI will not violate
              any of the Policies or any applicable law. The Customer is solely
              responsible for the development, content, operation, maintenance,
              and use of published assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              4.3 Where Customer permits, assists or facilitates such action,
              Customer will be deemed to have taken any action by any person or
              entity related to this Agreement, published assets or use of the
              JedAI. Customer is responsible for End Users’ use of published
              assets and the Brainstems Market. Customer will ensure that all
              End Users comply with obligations mirroring those of Customer
              under this Agreement and that the terms of Customer’s agreements
              with each End User are consistent with this Agreement. If Customer
              becomes aware of any violation of Customer’s obligations under
              this Agreement caused by an End User, Customer will immediately
              suspend access to published assets and the JedAI by such End User.
              Brainstems does not provide any support or services to End Users,
              unless Brainstems has a separate agreement with Customer or an End
              User obligating Brainstems to provide such support or services.

              5.1 If you elect to purchase, submit, or trade through the use of
              predictions on the JedAI, it will be conducted solely through the
              Oasis network via MetaMask (or other Oasis-compatible wallets,
              browsers, or software). We will have no insight into or control
              over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to
              reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no

              5.2 Oasis requires the payment of a transaction fee (a &apos;Gas Fee&apos;)
              for every transaction that occurs on the Oasis network. The Gas
              Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized
              Oasis network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for
              each transaction that occurs via the JedAI. In addition to the Gas
              Fee, we have hardcoded 0.1% of the total value of the transaction
              for the Brainstems Protocol community development fund. Customer
              acknowledges and agrees that the Commission will be transferred
              directly to the Brainstems Protocol community development fund
              through the Ethereum network as part of any transactions or
