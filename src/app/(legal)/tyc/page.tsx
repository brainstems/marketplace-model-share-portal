        <p className="mb-4">
          4.5 End Users. You will be deemed to have taken any action that you
          permit, assist or facilitate any person or entity to take related to
          this Agreement, Your Content or use of the Service Offerings. You are

          Offerings. You will ensure that all End Users comply with your
          obligations under this Agreement and that the terms of your agreement
          with each End User are consistent with this Agreement. If you become
          aware of any violation of your obligations under this Agreement caused
          by an End User, you will immediately suspend access to Your Content
          and the Service Offerings by such End User. We do not provide any
          support or services to End Users unless we have a separate agreement
          with you or an End User obligating us to provide such support or
          services.
        </p>

        <strong className="mb-4">5. Fees and Payment.</strong>

        <p className="mb-4">
          5.1 Service Fees. We calculate and bill fees and charges monthly. We
          may bill you more frequently for fees accrued if we suspect that your
          account is fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. You will pay us the
          applicable fees and charges for use of the Service Offerings as
          described on the OPPORTUNITY AI COMPANY Site using one of the payment
          methods we support. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement
          will be paid to us without setoff or counterclaim, and without any
          deduction or withholding. Fees and charges for any new Service or new
          feature of a Service will be effective when we post updated fees and
          charges on the OPPORTUNITY AI COMPANY Site, unless we expressly state
          otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and charges for
          any existing Services you are using by giving you at least 30 days’
          prior notice. We may elect to charge you interest at the rate of 1.5%
          per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late
          payments.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          5.2 Taxes. Each party will be responsible, as required under
          applicable law, for identifying and paying all taxes and other
          governmental fees and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other
          additions thereto) that are imposed on that party upon or with respect
          to the transactions and payments under this Agreement. All fees
          payable by you are exclusive of Indirect Taxes. We may charge and you
          will pay applicable Indirect Taxes that we are legally obligated or
          authorized to collect from you. You will provide such information to
          us as reasonably required to determine whether we are obligated to
          collect Indirect Taxes from you. We will not collect, and you will not
          pay, any Indirect Tax for which you furnish us a properly completed
          exemption certificate or a direct payment permit certificate for which
          we may claim an available exemption from such Indirect Tax. All
          payments made by you to us under this Agreement will be made free and
          clear of any deduction or withholding, as may be required by law. If
          any such deduction or withholding (including but not limited to
          cross-border withholding taxes) is required on any payment, you will
          pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount
          received by us is equal to the amount then due and payable under this
          Agreement. We will provide you with such tax forms as are reasonably
          requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount of any
          withholding or deduction for taxes in respect of payments made under
          this Agreement.

          of law rules, govern this Agreement and any dispute of any sort that

          13.5 Disputes. Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of
          the Service Offerings, or to any products or services sold or
          distributed by OPPORTUNITY AI COMPANY will be adjudicated in the
          Governing Courts, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue
          in the Governing Courts; except, if the applicable OPPORTUNITY AI
          COMPANY Contracting Party is Opportunity AI Company, any such dispute
          will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this Section
          13.5, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small
          claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and
          federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or
          jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is
          limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the
          same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and
          declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of
          this Agreement as a court would. To begin an arbitration proceeding,
          you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your
          claim to our registered agent Cogency Global Inc., 850 New Burton
          Road, Suite 201, Dover, DE, 19904. The arbitration will be conducted
          by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, which
          are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of
          filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the
          AAA&apos;s rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less
          than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are
          frivolous. We will not seek attorneys&apos; fees and costs in arbitration
          unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may
          choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on
          written submissions, or at a mutually agreed location. We and you
          agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only
          on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or
          representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court
          rather than in arbitration we and you waive any right to a jury trial.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing we and you both agree that you or we may
          bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of
          intellectual property rights.
